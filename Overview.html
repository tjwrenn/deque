The description below explains some highlights of our implementation.<BR><BR>1) The private ensureCapacity() function grows the capacity by the same number of elements on each end.  <BR><BR>2) The __instances variables monitors deque allocation and deallocation. By termination, __instances should be zero. Otherwise, a memory leak has occured.<BR><BR>3) Similar to begin() and end(), middle() is defined to speedup the scoot when inserting into the middle.  For instance, if youinsert into a position in the deque in the first half, it's much easierto scoot the elements down from index 0 up to index followed byinserting the new element at the index'th position than from index up toend().  By symmetry, inserting into a position in the second half hassimilar complexity.  Even though this is still O(N), the max number ofadjustments is O(N/2) as explained by here.  Aslightly modified version of the same argument works for erase as well.<br></td></tr></table></body></html>
